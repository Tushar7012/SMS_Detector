🔍 About the Project
This project is a Machine Learning-based SMS Spam Detector that classifies messages as spam or ham (not spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It helps in filtering out unwanted messages and improving communication security.

📌 Features
✅ Text Preprocessing: Removes special characters, converts text to lowercase, and tokenizes words.
✅ TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts SMS text into numerical features for model training.
✅ ML Model Training: Uses models like Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, or Random Forest for classification.
✅ Real-time Prediction: Enter an SMS and get an instant spam detection result.
✅ Streamlit Web App (Optional): A simple and interactive UI for spam detection.

📂 Dataset
The model is trained on the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, containing labeled SMS messages as spam (1) or ham (0).
